One of the challenging problem is to find average customer time spent at billing counters.

Billing counters are the choke point for customers who want to leave as early as possible, operations team want to have fast flow of customers in and out. To fasten the billing process many Point of Sale counters are put up by operations team. But monitoring all these counters by an operations manager or branch head is cumbersome process and physical stores don't have any automatic alerts to inform the operations team if a specific counter is taking more time to process customer billing. They don't have daily reports of average customer waiting time for every counter in a given day.

See Cleverly solves this problem by analysing CCTV Feed in real time and produces live trackable charts for each billing counter.
